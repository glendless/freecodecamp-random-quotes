## üìÇ Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the key files in this project:

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quotes.json     # Contains the array of quotes, authors, and professions.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css             # Main stylesheet for animations and component styling.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Component.tsx       # The main React component for the quote machine UI and logic.

- **`src/assets/quotes.json`**: A simple JSON file that acts as a local database for the quotes.
- **`src/App.css`**: Contains all the custom CSS, including styles for the layout, buttons, and the keyframe animations for quote transitions and the spinning refresh icon.
